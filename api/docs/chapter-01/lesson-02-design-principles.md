# Design Principles of Humanoid Robots

## Mechanical Design

The mechanical design of humanoid robots involves several key considerations that affect their functionality and performance.

## Degrees of Freedom

Humanoid robots typically have multiple degrees of freedom (DOF) to enable complex movements. The number and placement of joints significantly impact the robot's capabilities.

## Actuators and Motors

High-torque actuators are essential for humanoid robots to maintain balance and perform various tasks. The choice of actuators affects power consumption, precision, and overall performance.

## Materials and Construction

Modern humanoid robots use a combination of lightweight materials such as:

- Carbon fiber composites
- Advanced polymers
- Aluminum alloys
- Specialized joint mechanisms

## Balance and Stability

Maintaining balance is one of the most challenging aspects of humanoid robot design. Engineers must consider:

- Center of mass
- Support polygon
- Reaction control systems
- Dynamic stability algorithms
