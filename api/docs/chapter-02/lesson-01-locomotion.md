# Locomotion in Humanoid Robots

## Walking Patterns

Humanoid robots employ various walking patterns to achieve stable locomotion. The most common approaches include:

## Static Walking

Static walking involves maintaining the center of mass within the support polygon at all times. This approach is stable but can be slow.

## Dynamic Walking

Dynamic walking allows the center of mass to move outside the support polygon temporarily. This approach enables faster and more natural movement.

## Gait Generation

Generating stable gaits requires sophisticated algorithms that consider:

- Foot placement
- Center of mass trajectory
- Joint angle coordination
- Balance control

## Balance Control Systems

Modern humanoid robots use several systems to maintain balance:

- Inertial measurement units (IMUs)
- Force/torque sensors in feet
- Feedback control algorithms
- Predictive control models

## Challenges in Locomotion

Achieving human-like locomotion remains challenging due to:

- Complex dynamics
- Real-time control requirements
- Environmental variations
- Energy efficiency constraints
