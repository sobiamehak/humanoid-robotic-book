- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [ ] No implementation details leak into specification - TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS WERE REQUESTED BY USER

## Notes

- The specification includes technical implementation details as explicitly requested by the user in the original requirements
- Despite containing technical details, the core user value and business needs are clearly defined
- Specification is ready for planning phase with awareness of technical content
